/**
 * A custom Electron Forge plugin purpose-built for this project. This plugin is not designed as a generic and reusable
 * piece of software. This plugin is tailored to the exact technology and architecture of this project. Specifically, the
 * plugin incorporates a webpack-based build strategy into the Electron Forge build process. The plugin embeds specific
 * webpack configuration that describes the entrypoints and customizations desired by this project.
 *
 * This plugin is heavily adapted from Electron Forge's own webpack plugin: https://www.electronforge.io/config/plugins/webpack
 * It's not possible to use the official plugin because of some key restrictions. Specifically, the official plugin hard
 * codes the configuration of the HtmlWebpackPlugin, and it disables all webpack logging. See these related links
